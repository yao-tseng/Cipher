Atbash Cipher

Type: Substitution
Difficulty: Easy

Description:

Atbash is a type of cipher that takes the alphabet and maps it to its 
reverse. The first letter becomes the last letter and the second letter 
becomes the second to last letter and so on.

This is a particularly easy cipher in that it does not require a key.

Method:

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

becomes

z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
